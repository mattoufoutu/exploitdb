# exploitdb

Shell-style script to search exploit-db.com exploits.

## Introduction

There is already a similar script shipped with the Kali distribution, but I think it's not
flexible enough. This script is an attempt at providing a more flexible tool, with a fancy
shell-style interface.

## Features

* shell-style interface
* search in any field
* update database and exploit files with the `updatedb` command
* commands completion

## TODO

* regex search in descriptions
* quoted search patterns
* highlight search matches
* display a progress bar when downloading exploits archive
* colored results
* provide completion for platform and type values
