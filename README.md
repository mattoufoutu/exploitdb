# exploitdb

Shell-style script to search exploit-db.com exploits.

## Introduction

There is already a similar script shipped with the Kali distribution, but I think it's not
flexible enough. This script is an attempt at providing a more flexible tool, with a fancy
shell-style interface.

## Features

* shell-style interface
* search in any field
* update database and exploit files with the `updatedb` command
* commands completion
* highlighted search matches

## Usage

Just run the `exploitdb.py` script without any argument, you will be given a pseudo-shell interface.

### Searching exploits

The `search` command allows you to search for a given pattern in any field of the original exploit-db's
CSV file. The search query must be in the form of `field_name:pattern` couples, if no field name is
given, `description` is the default.

Available fields are:
* `id` - the internal exploit's ID
* `file` - the path where the exploit file can be found
* `description` - informations about the targetted software
* `date` - the date the exploit was released
* `author` - well, self-explanatory, huh?
* `type` - exploit classification, possible values are:
    * `local`
    * `shellcode`
    * `dos`
    * `remote`
    * `webapps`
* `platform` - the platform type the exploit runs on

### Getting exploit infos

To show all the available details about an exploit, use the `info` command. This command takes a
single argument, which is the ID of the exploit you want details for.

### Updating database

Running the `updatedb` command will download the latest exploits archive from exploit-db.com and
extract it in an `exploits` folder in current directory.
